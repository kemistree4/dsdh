# # Data Science for Digital Health Glossary
# To make room for new concepts we compress complex concepts into words.
# And then we can compress several words into acronyms to consolidate multiple complex concepts under one "umbrella" concept.
# Smart people can think analogously across domains, sharing words and concepts and brain neurons between domains.


Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): A developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. It is called a *developmental disorder* because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. It is called a *spectrum disorder* because a wide range of behaviors are associated with the condition and these behaviors a often ranked on a linear scale from less severe to more sever. #medicine #neuroscience #clinical #healthcare #psychology

Chromosome: DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism often including packaging proteins which help maintain the 3D structure of the lengthy sequence of nucleic acids and chaperone proteins which aid in accurate transcription of the DNA into RNA and proteins. The cells of the human body each contain 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs of duplicate chromosomes. #genomics #healthcare
CV (Computer Vision): Processing images for classification, segmentation, or object detection or processing video for object tracking and SLAM. This term is often used to referred to \"classical\" computer vision algorithms based on human-crafted algorithms like HOG and SIFT, rather than machine learning or deep learning models like VGG16, ImageNet, or SSD neural networks. #data-science #deep-learning #computer-vision #L1

Extraction, Transform, Load (ETL): The process of retrieving data from a website or database and then transforming it into a numerical matrix that can be loaded into a table to be used in plots or a data science model.
EHR (Electronic Health Records): In the US managed healthcare plans such as those administered by Kaiser have led the way in consolidating patient records into a normalized electronic database that can be accessed patients, doctors, and insurers and shared across hospital systems in multiple states. EHRs are the fuel for the Data Science machine that promises to decouple quality and cost of healthcare.
Explainability: Deep learning models are difficult to interpret or explain because they have millions of trainable parameters across many layers. Tensorflow-Explain is a package that implements simplified visualizations. See [this blog post, bit.ly/ucsdexplain](https://blog.sicara.com/tf-explain-interpretability-tensorflow-2-9438b5846e35) for more info. #data-science #deep-learning #computer-vision #data-science #NLP #deep-learning #data-science

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM): A computer vision model (usually a classical human-crafted algorithm) that is designed to estimate the location plus orientation of the camera and also simultaneously estimate the location and pose of objects in the scene in a real-time video feed. Deep learning approaches are beginning to compete favorably with classical computer vision for in accuracy, but they still far less efficient (slower to compute). #computer-vision #data-science #robotics
Smoothed Gradient (SmoothGrad): In [a 2017 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05598.pdf) Smilkov invented a technique for smoothing the gradient by perturbing the input image with weak noise. It produces a better estimate of pixel importances, the "leverage" they have to affect the predictions. #computer-vision #data-science #deep-learning #data-science #L5 #L9

SMA usually results in infant death by the age of 20 months. In late 2019 the FDA approved a gene therapy costing $2.1M and Novartis offered 100 doses on a lottery system to those in countries where it is not yet approved, causing ethics concerns among physicians. #healthcare #genetics
Uncanny Valley: In 1970 Masahiro Mori coined the phrase "Uncanny Valley" to refer to the dip in user satisfaction with humanoid robotic faces and bodies when they get too good uncannily good at imitating human behavior, but not good enough for us to forget that they are a simulation or a computer program. This may be due to our finely tuned instinct to read facial expressions and look for signs of illness or psychological instability in the faces of other humans. This is also called the "Mori Uncanny Valley." #nlp #robotics #ai #data-science #healthcare
