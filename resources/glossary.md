# Glossary

SaMD (Software as a Medical Device):  The FDA has proposed to regulate AI and ML technology used in medicine as a medical device.
HIPPA (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): In 2003 US Congress passed HIPPA which regulates insurance companies
PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Information like birtdates, names, and social security numbers which can be used alone or in combination with other pieces of information to identify an individual. An age over 80 in hospital records is considered PII all by itself.
Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information
HHS (Health and Human Services): Publishes guidelines and standards regulating the electronic exchange of health information.
Scoping Review: Paper study, literature review, metadata analysis
Gap Analsyis: Examining scoping review results to look for oportunities for additional research.
GIS (Geographic Information System): geolocation data analysis and visualization tools
MLE (Maximum Liklihood Estimator): statistical model that the target is a linear combination of randomly-distributed variables (see GMM)
GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model): statistical model that the target is a linear combination of gaussian-distributed variables (see GMM)
[Grad-CAM](http://gradcam.cloudcv.org/) (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping): A measure of pixel importance based on the gradient of the activation for the class label of the image/region.
CV (Computer Vision): Processing images for classification, segmentation, or object detection or processing video for object tracking and SLAM. This term is often used to referred to "classical" computer vision algorithms based on human-crafted algorithms like HOG and SIFT, rather than machine-learned models like neural networks.
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): A computer vision model (usually a classical human-crafted algorithm) that is designed to estimate the location plus orientation of the camera and also simultaneously estimate the location and pose of objects in the scene in a real-time video feed. Deep learning approaches are beginning to compete favorably with classical computer vision for in accuracy, but they still far less efficient (slower to compute).
[VGG16]
[SmoothGrad](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05598.pdf): In 2017 Smilkov invented a technique for smoothing the gradient by perturbing the input image with weak noise. It produces a better estimate of pixel importances: the "leverage" they have to affect the predictions.
[Explainability](bit.ly/ucsdexplain): Deep learning models are difficult to interpret or explain because they have millions of traininable parameters across many layers. Tensorflow-Explain is a package that implements simplified visualizations https://blog.sicara.com/tf-explain-interpretability-tensorflow-2-9438b5846e35
AKI (Acute Kidney Injury): DeepMind can predict kidney injury (damage to the kidney from mediations or diabetes or kidney disease) 2 days in advance with [56% accuracy](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614046/deepminds-algorithm-can-predict-serious-kidney-injury-48-hours-before-it-happens/).
ACP (American College of Physicians): Publish guidelines such as bi-annual mammograms after the age of 60
CBE (Clinical Breast Exam): ACP no longer recommends as of 2019. Mammograms instead.
