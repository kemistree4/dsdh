# Biomedical Computing Course at MIT

[Syllabus | Biomedical Computing | Health Sciences and Technology | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-950j-biomedical-computing-fall-2010/syllabus/)

> ## Description
>
> The US is about to invest at least tens of billions of dollars in healthcare information technology (HIT), hoping to create the information base for improving access to care, continuity of care, medical decision making, and reduction in errors. At the same time, we hope to make more rational the delivery of care, providing the most effective and least expensive interventions possible. This shift, if it is to be accomplished successfully, will require not only vastly improved infrastructure but also improved methods of learning from experience.
>
> Contemporary medical care requires health care providers (and patients and their families) to know a great deal about the diseases, genetic predispositions, signs and symptoms, treatments and medications of each individual. To exploit the potential contributions of improvements in our understanding of genomics, proteomics and the "new biology," we must combine such data with the clinical data that represent the patient’s phenotype. We must also develop new analytical methods to find the important relationships among these data, and then apply them in many settings to improve health care. These needs form an intriguing engineering challenge described in this class, along with methods and practices aimed at their solution.
>
> This class will serve as an introduction to the computing challenges in health care. We present the nature of contemporary health care, the types of data available for guiding decision making, research and analysis, the growing body of biological data and knowledge that underlie health care, and methods to develop models that can enhance applications from decision support to clinical research. We also look at applications of these ideas in electronic medical records, personal health records, telemedicine for developing countries, public health surveillance, and institutional and national scale infrastructures. Many of these latter topics will be presented by guest lecturers who are leaders in their fields.

> Project proposals:
>
> Please submit proposals for projects for the class. Students may complete the project alone or pair up with one or two other students. It is generally quite helpful for each team to include students with different backgrounds. Topics for projects can include anything that is relevant to the class material. Your proposal should include a list of the people who will be working on the project, a title, and a one-page description, with enough detail that the instructor can provide feedback to help direct your work.
>
> ## Final Project Presentations
>
> Each single student will have a 15 minute slot, including time to set up and take questions and teams will have 25 minutes. Presentations should be no longer than 10-12 minutes for individuals, and about 20 minutes for teams.
