::: notes

Medical imagery can be used to diagnose injury like broken bones, torn ligaments, trauma, skin abnormalities, and damage to your retina or cornea (lasers, arc welding, sun damage).
Medical imagery is also used to diagnose disease like pulmonary disease, cardio-vascular disease, and even psychological abnormalities.
Data science tools are contributing in all of these areas.
