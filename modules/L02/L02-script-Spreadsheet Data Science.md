# 9: Healthcare Applications

- Medical iamgery

# Medical imagery for diagnosis

- broken bones
- tumors
- pneumothorax
- retina damage

::: notes

Medical imagery can be used to diagnose injury like broken bones, torn ligaments, trauma, skin abnormalities, and damage to your retina or cornea (lasers, arc welding, sun damage).
Medical imagery is also used to diagnose disease like pulmonary disease, cardio-vascular disease, and even psychological abnormalities.
Data science tools are contributing in all of these areas.

# Medical imagery for postoperative assessment

- Damage to tumors
- Ablative "tracks" in hear muscle
- Collatoral damage to healthy tissue

# 10: DIY Spreadsheet Data Science

- Fitness (step counters)
- Stress, anxiety, and depression
- Sleep apnea (CPAP data streams, smart watches)
- Heart disease (smart watches)
- Insulin pump hack
- Parkinson disease medication pump

Just as the rise in citizen science has enabled people around the wolrd to contribute to environmental conservation and climate science efforts so has the "Quantified Self" movement created an army self-service healthcare practitioners.
In some cases people are even using Data Science to diagnose and in some cases treat serious illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and parkinsons disease.
And in most cases, even for these serious illnesses self-service data science is being performed in spreadsheets.
So in this course we'll start there, but then show you how the more advanced tools available to you within the Python ecosystem can improve upon the crude spreadsheet models.
