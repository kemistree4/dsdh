::: notes
The debate around smoking wasn't entirely the fault of big tobacco lobbying groups. Many doctors and statisticians believed their own statistical analyses that show
At the very end of this long discussion of all the techniques that have been used in the past, and how they are all flawed in one way or another, it finally mentions at the very end that a multivariate model designed with domain knowledge and a causal model are the only way to be sure.

# Causal Revolution

::: notes
Sometimes prediction is not enough. To cure diseases, to save lives, you need a causal model.

# 2: Paradoxes and Fallacies


- Berkson Paradox: why the more attractive people that you date tend to be jerks
- Simpson's Paradox: why politicians can win elections without winning the popular vote (gerymandrring,  electoral college)
- Monty Hall Fallacy: why you should always change your answer in Let's Make a Deal game show

# 3: Monty Hall Fallacy

Real life applications:

- you suspect a patient has one of 3 genes that could cause a disease and you plan to treat based on that one genetic abnormality, then another doctor does a test that confirms the patient does not have one of the others. Should you change your treatment? (must assume that only 1 Gene is present otherwise the abnormality would be greater and the cause obvious, like XOR condition).
- collider on the door chosen to be opened by Monty Hall

# 4: Explain Away Fallacy

- collider where one cause negates the other
- two possible causes of test results then find out that one cause is present, that makes it less likely that the other cause is present

# 5: Berkson's Paradox

- 2 diseases required for admission to hospital (admission's bias) causing `bone disease` and `resperatory disease` to be correlated

                   , general populaiton, general populaiton, general populaiton, hospitalized
resperatory disease, bone disease yes,    bone disease no,   % bone disease,


# 6: Before Cause there was Corroboration

- strength of correlation
- agreement with physics

# Bayesean vs Frequentist Inference, P-value, and confidence intervals
