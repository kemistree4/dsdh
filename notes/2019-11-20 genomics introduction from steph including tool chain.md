align genome to reference
reference genome GRCH38 most popular one that people use because public databases will annotate based on the reference
software with compression
BWA software -- maps your reads and and trims them to get rid of adapters, tags on adapter sequences are added during sequencing, get .SAM file
Bowtie also common
.SAM -> variant culling program Freebayes or GATK from the Broad Institute -> .VCF file
after your run before your variant culling FASTQC measures the quality of the run, technical issues like contaminants
molecular markers used to norm

.VCF file
variants at chromosome location, then Clinvar NIH largest repository of variants and clinical significance, chromosome location, and it tells you whether its pathogenic and whether research has been done, benign, or unknown

chemical pathways
UK biobank (EHR) as partner and other governments want to duplicate UK biobank

need to write up a proposal to UK biobank, value in study, grant proposal, we're looking at structural variants, long read sequences that they haven't done
, plus structural variation,



- Illumina made technology of sequencing available
- RNA is another area of interest after genome, transcriptomics
- proteomics (proteins)
- microbiome,
- metabalomics (chemistry)
- epigenetics
- "omics" approach
- clinical medical re
