# Genome as Natural Language

## Case study: Luna DNA

- personalized medicine
- crowd sourced healthcare and DNA data (100k DNA sequences voluntarily contributed)
- founder Diane berry (digital health expert)

## DSDH Genomics Intro

### GWAS (Genome-wide Association Study) for Breast Cancer

- familial breast cancer linked to brca01 gene or SNP variation
- single gene found to cause hereditary breast cancer in the 90s after a long arduous search
- heroic scientist mined Mormon ancestry databases and found correlations that helped identify the chromosome

### GWAS for Huntington's disease

- Huntington's disease
- protein expressed in neurons
- chromosome region of interest has 1000s of base pairs
- 20-30 CAG repeats are ok
- ~50+ CAG repeats causes disease and shows up later in life
- too many repeats causes protein to clump up and get tangled

### Heat stress

- Heat stress DNA proteins unfold.
- Hormesis principle, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
- Heat stress below lethal creates bodily strength to withstand further stress
- mechanism may be similar to working out
- Like during fever, some genes are expressed to create proteins
- Exercise causes genes to be expressed that cause muscle growth proteins/hormones
- Antioxidants may be counter-productive during low level stress, because antioxidants would break up and reduce stress hormones
- Iceland saunas may be responsible for longevity as much as diet and lifestyle

### Parsing Sequences into Tokens/Genes

- Biopython, converts/translates DNA sequency to RNA sequencey or converts RNA to protein
- Telemeres mark the ends of chromosomes (diagram of an X or Y chromosome with telemeres at tip)
- Centremeres mark the middle of X or fork in Y chromosome
- Open reading frames, always start with ATG sequence, these code for amino acids
- Codons ATG nnn nnn
- UTA is a stop codon
- ATG UTA (or one of the other 3 "stop codons")
- UTR: untranslated regulator
DNA -> RNA (mRNA..)
Destroy, not destroy codons
