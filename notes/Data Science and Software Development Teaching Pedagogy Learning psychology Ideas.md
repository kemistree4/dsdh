# Data Science and Software Development Teaching Ideas

## 1. Assignment, Markdown your Motivation

Use the command line (bash shell prefered) to create a directory in your home directory called `code`, for example: `mkdir ~/code`.
Then create another directory to hold your learning for this course e.g. `mkdir ~/code/my-fun-new-course`.
Open your text editor and create a project that displays this directory tree in your IDE sidebar. In sublime this would be in the Project Menu, add folder to project, then save project.

Compose a reasons "reasons why" document in markdown format using Sublime Text 3 or VSCode or PyCharm.

Try to use the key features of markdown:

- multilevel headings (`#`, `##`, and `###`)
- bold and italic text
- bullets
- **STRETCH**: use a checklist (such as a list of things you want to accomplish)
