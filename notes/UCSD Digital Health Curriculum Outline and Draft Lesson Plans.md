## Description

Learn the fundamentals of the rapidly evolving, multidisciplinary field of Digital Health and its associated disruption of healthcare. The 100% online program combines aspects of healthcare administration, data
science, public health, ethics and strategies for commercialization and business development.  Courses analyze new opportunities for digital technology to improve individual and population health outcomes and provide innovative solutions within the complex industry of healthcare.  Leading innovators from academia and industry will explore the implementation of e‐health, m‐health (mobile health), connected health, big data in medicine, machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to healthcare.

Digital Health’s impact integrating disruptive medical innovations to can change healthcare outcomes, at both the patient and population health level, will be examined. Telemedicine, smart algorithms and wearable health trackers now make it possible to stream medical data from any location, allowing patients access to care nearly instantly. Studies have shown that medical outcomes can improve and costs can be reduced when technology like artificial intelligence is combined with the human touch of physicians. The certificate offers a unique educational experience for those working in healthcare technology roles, research, entrepreneurial, and regulatory entities in the healthcare space.

0. Introduction to Probability and Statistics
  - Pascal & Fermat's letters debating the fair way to split the pot for a game of flip the coin, best of 5. Interupted at 3 flips. 2 for Fermat and 1 for Pascal. 3:1 split (.75, .25) was the correct split
  - If you roll 6-sided dice, and sum the count of the dots facing up (1-6 dots on each face), and then you had to bet on a particular number coming up, which one would you bet on? 7, not because it's lucky but because it is the most common future if you count up all the possible futures that can happen and assume that each of them are equally probable. this isn't too different
  - What if there were 6 independent genes that each add 1 inch of height to a child's height. Assume that each parent has a 50/50 chance of having each of these genes. Assume the minimimum adult height from among this particular gene pool is 5 feet. So if both parents have all 6 genes and
  - Fischer's P-value test came from teh 8 cups of tea test with expert "lady" sorting them into tea poured into milk and milk poured into tea. Statistically significant even though the results may not actually be that useful, interesting, or have low magnitutde. P-value just means it should be investigated and is worthy of a second look, reproduce the results, not that it is a certain fact that your results are valid
  - sampling your genes involves taking a bit of blood, not taking all your blood, and certainly not harvesting all your organs. but it turns out this is not a representative sample, because there's statistically a different genome in each of your organs. this mosaic of mutations is most diverse in the skin, esophagus, and blood, because they have a higher rate of cell division, and the skin and esophugus are more likely to be exposed to toxins or ionizing radiation.

# Bayes Rule

Bayes lived in the early 1700s, yet most doctors do not use his formula when making decisions about treatment.

The [American Cancer Society revised the mamogram guidlines](https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/american-cancer-society-releases-new-breast-cancer-guidelines.html) because doctors often misinterpret the results.

## Notes/Ideas

- bayes rule
  - data scientists helping doctors make better decisions
  - mamogram AMA guidelines
- clinical
  - research: who makes treatment recommendations/guidelines?
  - research: pharmaceutical drug interactions database?
- causal revolution
  - smoking -> lung disease diagrams
  - 1987
  - recent fails
- neural networks (deep learning)
  - neuron diagram
  - matrix algebra
  - linear regression
  - back propagation
