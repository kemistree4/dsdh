To make room for new concepts we have to compress complex concepts into words. Then we have to compress words into acronyms. Consolidate multiple concepts into one "umbrella" concept. Smart people can think analogously across domains. **IDEA**: is there a graph pattern that allows analogies and generalizations to encode themselves in the edges/weights of an ANN?

## CS

### DS, ML, AI

- singleton
- dependency injection
- inheritance
- polymorphism?
- map, mapping
- set
- random forest
- HEAD, last commit in the DAG of changes/commits (including merges)
- ANN, neural net, artificial neural network, Deep learning network

- 

### Math -- wiki/graph_theory_glossary

- set theory
- topology
- homology
- isomorphism 
- automorphism, graph symmetry, graph isomorphism to itself
- graph
- network
- edge, arc
- arrow, directed edge with a tail and head
- vertex, node
- a, achromatic number, num colors in coloring
- forest, undirected acyclic grapg
- dag, directed acyclic graph
- adjacency matrix
- Apex, universal vertex, vertex adjacent to all other vertices
- arborescence, rooted directed tree
- bag, a set of vertices in a tree decomposition
- tree decomposition, G labeled with bags, each bag contains a subtree, all subtrees must contain all the connected edges within it
- treewidth, max number of vertices in any bag of a tree decomp minus 1
- clique number, order of a graphs largest clique
- clique, set of mutually adjacent vertices, sometimes defines as maximal complete (fully connected) subgraph that is not part of any such larger subgraph
- chordal decomposition
- chord, chordal, edge not in cycle wise endpoints are in cycle 
- cycle, edges connected to self through other edges in the cycle
- bipartite G, G has no odd cycles, 2 sets o vertices which are not directlt connected, but are all connecred to the other set, can be colored with 2 colors
- cherry, a path on 3
