## [Wiki Genetics Glossary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetics_glossary)

- SNP, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, substitution at a single nucleotide position that occurs in at least 1% of the population, e.g.  rs6311 and rs6313 Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor gene on chromosome 13
- SNV, single nucleotide variation, SNP below or above 1% populating frequency threshold for SNPs 
    - coding gene region SNPs
    - noncoding gene SNPs
    - intergenic region of DNA (between genes)
- synonymous SNPs
- nonsynonymous SNPs
    - missense
    - nonsense
- degeneracy (of genetic code), some SNPs do not change the amino acid sequence (protein) produced by that gene
- 
- 
- allele
- chromosome
