FASTA-old pubmed name for full genome sequences
full genome sequence is introns + exons
genome map has loci
numbered by chromosomes
chromosome 11 position/letter/nucleotide 359 => 11.359
gene = segment of chromosome nucleotides

introns: noncoding regions ("junk" DNA) that noone knows what they do
exons: coding regions of DNA that are used to manufacture proteins in the body, these are the parts sequenced by 23andme etc

cell copies exon DNA segment to mRNA which leaves the nucleaus and is used to manufacture proteins within the cell which build the cell structure and machinery. while mRNA is being copied inside the nucleus both intron and exons are copied, but the mRNA is cut and spliced to remove all intron mRNA so that only exon RNA ever leaves the cell nucleus.

prokaryotes (bacteria and archea): have no cell nucleus and no organelles with membranes. they have and only exons in their genes so they produce only simple single-cell organisms
eukaryotes (cells of all multicellular organisms): have a cell nucleus and membrane-bound organnels within each cell, like mitochondria. Eukaryotes include both single-cell and multicellular organisms and have both intron and exon DNA in their nuclei

kevin clancy, intern, timeline on gene
intern
raw sequence data, kevin clancy to pull out the variants


11.359-11.700 start to finish on region of sequence = one "gene" that determines phenotype

chromosome lengths may vary between individuals and within individuals
gene lengths vary

align query genome downlowed with the reference genome (from human genome map/sequence)
2 standards on what that is
sequence that I downloaded

stephanie has 3 complete familes that had whole genome sequenced with family history of disease
also getting access to UK database of genomes
