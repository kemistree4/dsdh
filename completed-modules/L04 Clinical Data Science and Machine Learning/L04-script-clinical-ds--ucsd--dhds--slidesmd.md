# 2: PII

- birthday
- age (80+) + hospital

# 3: clinical trials

# clinical trial advantages

- compensates for confounding variables
- requires fewer trials, fewer patients at risk

# bias/flaw: gender

Due to birth defects caused by diet pills (fen fen?) Women were excluded from future drug trials

# bias/flaw: age

Terminally ill patients on risky drug trials are old and may not have same side effects. Existing conditions may mask side effects (especially cognitive, endurance, and other difficult to assess illnesses)

# bias/flaw: youth

Youth used in psych and exercise and trials (before brain fully formed)

# PII

Also a big part of hospital performance metric (in addition to outcomes, and case difficulty)

# prescriptive vs descriptive

# exercise: predict diabetes risk
