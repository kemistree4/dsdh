# Spreadsheet Data Science

-
Q: What are some potential advantages of spreadsheet data science when compared to programatic data science?
A:
    - Most people that can use a computer skills can help giving your a much broader perspective on the data and the results.
    - Greater transparency.
    - Greater buyin from stakeholders and collaborators who have access to the spreadsheet.
    - Greater transportability.
    - Greater modularity (data and code are consolidated in one file).
    - Data errors are sometimes more aparent.
-
Q: What are some limitations of spreadsheet data science when compared to programatic data science?
A:
    - It's slower.
    - Not parallelizable.
    - Because it's slower and not parallelizable you can iterate
    - It is generally limited to smaller datasets.
    - For large datasets, transparency and approachability will be reduced.
    - Data errors are sometimes more aparent.
-
Q: How much data does it take data to be "Big Data"?
    - Files larger than a GB are usually too large to load into RAM and manipulate efficiently.
-
Q: What is "swap space"? What is "swapping"?
    - Swap space is the hard drive space that is used as memory (RAM) for your computer when it runs out of memory (RAM).
Q: How can you tell if your computer is swapping?
