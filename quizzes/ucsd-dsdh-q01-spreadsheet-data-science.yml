-
Q: What are some limitations of spreadsheet data science when compared to programatic data science?

    - It's slower.
    - Not parallelizable.
    - Because it's slower and not parallelizable you can iterate
    - It is generally limited to smaller datasets.
    - For large datasets, transparency and approachability will be reduced.
    - Data errors are sometimes more aparent.
